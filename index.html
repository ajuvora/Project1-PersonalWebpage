      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I'm a software developer who likes to design unique UX UI designs in my free time. I also like to create electronic hardware printed circuit boards and write code for arduino. I'm fairly new to web development and would like to learn new things. I have created applications using blockchain and smart contracts. created Content Management System for a company called LPS New Zealand as well as developed a website for sharing Software devlopemnt related papers with featuresd such as administering, editing and uploading. </p>
      <p>I have won awards and certificates for the projects I had created in the past, One such project was called flexible suspension car. This car would let go of traditional suspension systems and woul;d rather flex the entire body of the car to accomodate for the bumps and dips on the road. The car would also take the payload inside the car into coinsideration and manage to flex accordingly. I have also been offered awarded with training and internship at Siemens for Mechatronics through my University in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>I now wish to finish my studies in Douglas College where I learn Diploma in Data science</p>
